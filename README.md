# HyPaD
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the Hybrid Patch Decomposition Algorithm to solve multi-objective mixed-integer convex optimization problems.

## Getting Started
You can start using HyPaD by downloading or cloning this repository using the green button near the top of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/LeoWarnow/HyPaD).
Then, just open the [UserFile.m](https://github.com/LeoWarnow/HyPaD/blob/main/UserFile.m).
It serves as an interface to the HyPaD algorithm and provides all instructions that you need to get started.

## References
As this implementation is based on the scientific work by [Gabriele Eichfelder](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/mmor/team/gabriele-eichfelder/) and [Leo Warnow](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/mmor/team/leo-warnow/), please cite the corresponding paper when using this code:
